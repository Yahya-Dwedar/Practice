      <p> MoYu WeiLong WR M MagLev boasts many updates when compared to the 2020 version.
           The main difference is the mechanism that creates the cubes elasticity/feeling. The WeiLong WR M MagLev features 2 repelling magnets instead
 of a spring beneath the center cap of each face. This creates a unique feel, and, along with the purple internals (which create a unique look, you end up with a very unique cube that is sure to stand out).
        The WeiLong MagLev features 5 different settings of adjustable magnet strength.</p>
